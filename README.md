## My Red Teaming & Learning Journey

I'm actively building my skills in offensive cybersecurity. Here's what I'm currently focused on:

* **THM Junior Penetration Tester Path:** Actively working through modules covering web explotaion, network exploitation, Burp Suite and Privilege Escalation techniques.
* **Core Concepts:** Solidifying my understanding of networking, operating systems (Linux & Windows), and scripting (primarily Python).
* **Tooling:** Gaining hands-on experience with industry-standard tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and various reconnaissance tools.
* **Vulnerability Analysis:** Learning to identify, understand, and safely exploit common vulnerabilities.
* **Adversary Emulation:** Studying frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to understand attacker methodologies and how to simulate them ethically.

My repositories will showcase my learning and personal projects. Expect to see:
* **Thought metholedgy on challenges** methodologies, and key takeaways from TryHackMe challenges.
* **THM Write-ups/Notes:** My solutions, methodologies, and key takeaways from TryHackMe rooms and paths.
